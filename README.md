# NetworkReduction

Code as part of paper "Iterative structural coarse graining for propagation dynamic in complex network"

The code is used to perform the numerical simulation and visualization. For more detailed information, please see the paper. 

## Describtion

The project propose a Iterative structural coarse-graining method to reduce the size of network and preserve the dynamical behavior of SIR model.
